# postal-code-data

Barebones JS dataset of country postal code types, regular expressions and placeholders for use in address form postal code validation for shipping with major shipping companies. Includes a few utility functions for common usage with inputs.

Country list source: [postal-country-region-data](https://github.com/tobias7an/postal-country-region-data). These two repos are used together and countries should not be added/removed from one without the same on the other.

Data is cross-referenced between the [Universal Postal Union Postal Addressing Systems Database](http://www.upu.int/en/activities/addressing/postal-addressing-systems-in-member-countries.html), postal service websites, shipping company APIs, and propietary commercial shipping address databases. 

This dataset may not be 100% accurate, complete or up to date, but aims to be sufficiently complete for production use and preferable to available alternatives.

This dataset is targeted at supporting shipping API connections with DHL Express, UPS, FedEx, USPS and CanadaPost.
